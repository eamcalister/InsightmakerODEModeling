  </p>

  <p>
	Suppose you work for a drug company that has recently discovered a new cancer drug. It has been tried out on a small number of patients and now you need to study the results further before proceeding to widespread clinical trials. The model describing the relative (as a percentage of maximal possible tumor size, thus dimensionless) radius <m>r</m> of a tumor for a dosage of relative size <m>k\geq 0</m> is given by the differential equation
<me>
r' = \alpha\frac{(1-r)r}{1+r} - kr,
</me>
where <m>\alpha\geq 0 </m> is a parameter called the <term>intrinsic growth rate</term>. The time units are months. Suppose, throughout this worksheet, that at time of detection <m>r=.05</m>.
  </p>

  <exercise>
	<statement>
		<p>
			Explain why the expressions <m>\alpha\dfrac{(1-r)r}{1+r}</m> and <m>kr</m> are both always positive. Develop an Insight with one inflow, one outflow, and two variables (with sliders). (<em>For students turning this in, you will need to submit your Insightmaker files.</em>)
		</p>
	</statement>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
	<statement>
		<p>
			Use the model you have developed above to describe the long-run behavior of the tumor under each of the following scenarios:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>k=0</m> (no treatment)
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>\alpha = 0</m> (no growth)
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		Explain why each of these results makes practical sense.
	</statement>

	</exercise>

  <exercise>
	<statement>
		<p>
			Determine the equilibrium solutions of the given model algebraically (show your work) and determine their stability depending on the values of <m>\alpha</m> and <m>k</m>. What is the desirable (in terms of real-world cancer treatment) in terms of the equilibria and stability of them, and how must <m>\alpha</m> and <m>k</m> be related to achieve this outcome. Include graphs from Insightmaker simulations to illustrate each possible outcome with descriptions that are accessible to a non-mathematical audience.
		</p>
	</statement>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="tumor_growth_estimate">
	<statement>
		<p>
			Suppose that after detection Patient #1 was given a regular dose of the drug with <m>k=1.5</m> and their tumor size grew according to the following table:
		</p>
		<table>
			<title>Tumor Size for Patient #1</title>
			<tabular>
				<row header="yes" bottom="medium">
					<cell>Time (months)</cell> <cell><m>r</m></cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>1 </cell><cell> 0.091677</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>2 </cell><cell> 0.152964</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>3 </cell><cell> 0.196308</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>4 </cell><cell> 0.217980</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>5 </cell><cell> 0.227098</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>6 </cell><cell> 0.230665</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</table>
	Use a converter for this data and the method of least-squares (recall how this was done in <xref ref="SprintModel"/>) to determine the intrinsic growth rate for this tumor.
	</statement>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
	<statement>
		<p>
			(Ethical Question) Suppose that possibly deadly side effects occur when the drug is administered with <m>k\gt 2.5</m>. Based on the results of patient #1, should widespread clinical trials proceed? Try to describe several considerations in your answer from the point of view of multiple stakeholders.
		</p>
	</statement>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
	<statement>
		<p>
			How realistic does this model feel? What aspects seem realistic and which ones don't? You can answer this mathematically as well as by doing a little internet research about cancer treatment.
